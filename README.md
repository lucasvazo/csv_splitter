# CSV Splitter

This project is a simple CSV splitter written in TypeScript. It takes a CSV file from the input folder, splits it into smaller CSV files based on the maximum file size specified by the user (in megabytes), and outputs the split files into the output folder.

## How to Use

1. **Install dependencies (ts node/types only):**
   ```bash
   npm install

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run app

Specify the maximum file size (in megabytes).
The application will split the CSV file from the input folder into smaller CSV files and save them in the output folder.
